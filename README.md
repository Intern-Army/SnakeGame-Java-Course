# SnakeGame-Java-Course
The Snake game is not a standalone gaming service but a software program written in Java. When executed, it loads a GUI-based game as the output, which serves as a practical demonstration of Java programming. This game is part of our educational services, where we teach students how to develop applications and games using Java.
